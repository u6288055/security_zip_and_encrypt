# Security Project
## Secured Zip

This is a university project for Security class. The problem is to do **Data compression and Encryption**. We are to develop a simple text compression program embedded with encryption/decryption functions. The encryption and decryption function must be performed automatically once saving or opening a compressed/uncompressed file. 

### How to run 

0. install [pyminizip](https://pypi.org/project/pyminizip/0.2.6/) if you haven't.
1. type `python security.py`
2. enter the file path you want to compress/decompress
3. enter password (if you leave it blank, the default password is "password")
